"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings
* The simulation environment was set up with a configuration of 10 agents over a 30-day period.
* Agents were initialized with randomized skill levels for farming, crafting, and gathering.
* The simulation loop processed each agent's actions and state changes daily, logging metrics such as age, energy, and skills.
* The average age of agents increased linearly, as expected, with each passing day.
* The average energy of agents decreased linearly due to a simple model where agents consume energy daily without a replenishment mechanism.
* The average skill levels for farming, crafting, and gathering remained constant throughout the simulation, indicating a lack of skill development or degradation in the current model.
* Helper functions were created to inspect agent memories and intervene by modifying agent attributes, such as their skills.

### Insights or Next Steps
* The current simulation model is a solid foundation, but to observe more complex emergent behaviors, it's crucial to implement mechanisms for skill progression based on agent actions and environmental interactions.
* Future enhancements should focus on introducing more dynamic elements, such as resource management, inter-agent communication, and environmental events, to create a more realistic and interactive simulation.
